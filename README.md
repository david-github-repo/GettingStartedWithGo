# Getting Started with Go

This repository contains my completed programming assignments for the "Getting Started with Go" course offered by the University of California, Irvine on Coursera.

## Course Projects

### Module 1: Hello World

- **[hello.go](./hello.go)**: A simple Hello World program that demonstrates the basic structure of a Go program.

### Module 2: Working with Data

- **[slice.go](./slice.go)**: A program that creates an integer slice, allows users to add integers, and maintains the slice in sorted order.

### Module 3: File Operations and Structs

- **[read.go](./read.go)**: A program that reads a text file containing names, creates name structs for each line, and displays the resulting data.

### Module 4: Interfaces and JSON

- **[makejson.go](./makejson.go)**: A program that prompts for a name and address, creates a map with this data, and converts it to JSON format.

## Running the Programs

To run any of the programs, navigate to this directory and use the `go run` command:

```bash
go run hello.go
go run slice.go
go run read.go
go run makejson.go
```
